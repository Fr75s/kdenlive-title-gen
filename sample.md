## Section 1

This is the first section of the video, not much to see here.

Clips are automatically made based on this text! Wow!

Content text (such as this) also automatically wraps around and lasts a variable amount of time, so if a certain line is very long, you have time and space to read it.

## Section 2

This is the next section.

Note that the frontmatter used for the title clip can be arranged in any order!

Also note that there is no conclusion section. Hopefully you have some other clip for that.

Additionally, any other video must be manually inserted. This is not a be all, end all solution to editing!
